# Unity Game Dev Is Pain

been using Unity for this VR project and remembered why game development is exercise in masochism. not just VR-specific stuff - Unity itself fights you every step of the way.

## version roulette

Unity releases new versions constantly. each one breaks something that worked in previous version. stay on old version? miss out on features and bug fixes. upgrade? spend days fixing things that weren't broken.

LTS versions supposed to be stable but "stable" means "breaks in different ways." 2022.3 LTS still has UI bugs from 2019. some physics interactions work differently between 2022.3.1 and 2022.3.15 for no documented reason.

can't just pick version and stick with it because packages require specific Unity versions. Meta XR SDK works with 2022.3+ but not 2023.2. some shader packages only work with 2021.3. asset store purchases locked to version ranges.

end up with multiple Unity installs eating disk space just to work on different projects.

## package manager hell

Unity's package system is disaster. packages have dependencies that conflict with each other. updating one package breaks three others. downgrading requires manually editing manifest files.

some packages only work with specific render pipelines. built-in render pipeline is deprecated but half your assets only work with it. URP is "universal" except for all the things it doesn't support. HDRP looks amazing but kills performance on anything less than RTX 4080.

package registry goes down randomly. suddenly can't import packages or build project because Unity can't reach servers. local development becomes impossible due to cloud dependency.

## inspector madness

Unity's inspector is inconsistent nightmare. some values update in real-time, others require stopping playmode. some properties show up in inspector, others are code-only for no reason.

arrays and lists in inspector are barely functional. reordering elements breaks references. deleting items leaves gaps. copying components sometimes works, sometimes creates broken duplicate references.

custom inspectors require learning Unity's immediate mode GUI system which feels like it's from 2003. modern UI frameworks exist but Unity pretends they don't.

## prefab system torture

prefabs are supposed to make reusable objects easy. instead they're source of constant frustration. modify prefab, breaks instances in unexpected ways. modify instance, can't apply changes back to prefab without overriding other instances.

nested prefabs multiply the confusion. changing parent prefab sometimes updates children, sometimes doesn't. unpacking prefabs loses connections permanently. prefab variants work until they don't.

overrides system shows you what changed but not why it changed or how to fix it when it breaks.

## build pipeline chaos

Unity's build system is black box of pain. builds work on your machine but not others. identical project settings produce different builds on different machines. build succeeds but executable crashes immediately with no useful error messages.

build times are insane for minor changes. change one script, rebuild entire project. IL2CPP compilation takes forever and fails with cryptic C++ errors. sometimes build works, sometimes identical build fails for no reason.

platform-specific issues multiply everything. android builds work in development but not release. ios builds require xcode knowledge just to fix Unity's broken output. webGL builds work in firefox but not chrome.

## performance profiling nightmare

Unity's profiler tells you everything except what you actually need to know. shows you're using too much memory but not which objects. shows frame drops but not what's causing them.

deep profiling kills performance so bad you can't profile actual performance issues. memory profiler crashes on large projects. GPU profiler only works with specific graphics cards and drivers.

optimization becomes guesswork. try random things until frame rate improves. no clear path from profiler data to actual solutions.

## asset pipeline confusion

Unity's asset import system has mind of its own. change texture import settings, reimports half your project. move files in explorer instead of Unity, breaks everything. rename folders, lose all references.

asset dependencies are invisible until something breaks. delete unused asset, discover it was referenced by script you forgot about. circular dependencies create import loops that lock up editor.

reimporting assets takes forever even when nothing changed. fresh project import can take hours on large projects. no clear way to speed up asset processing.

## scripting frustrations

Unity's C# integration is half-baked. some .NET features work, others don't. error messages are cryptic. autocomplete breaks randomly requiring editor restart.

serialization system has arbitrary limitations. can't serialize interfaces or abstract classes. custom serialization requires deep Unity knowledge. inspector breaks when serialization changes.

play mode changes don't persist. spend time tweaking values in play mode, stop playing, everything resets. have to remember to copy values back manually or write custom tools.

## documentation problems

Unity's documentation is either missing, wrong, or outdated. code examples use deprecated APIs. tutorials assume knowledge you don't have. community answers on forums are from 2018 and don't work anymore.

official Unity tutorials teach bad practices. beginner tutorials use GetComponent in Update loops. intermediate tutorials ignore performance entirely. advanced topics barely exist.

stack overflow answers are lottery. some brilliant, some completely wrong, no way to tell which until you try them.

## the reality

Unity development is constant problem solving where most problems aren't related to your actual game. spend more time fighting engine than creating content.

other engines exist but they have own problems. switching engines means learning everything again. Unity's problems are familiar problems.

stockholm syndrome sets in. start thinking workarounds are normal. "just restart Unity" becomes standard troubleshooting step.

## why we stay

despite everything Unity is still most accessible game engine for indies. asset store provides shortcuts around engine limitations. large community means solutions exist even if hard to find.

alternative is writing engine from scratch or using something with even worse tooling. Unity's problems are known quantities.

plus when things actually work Unity can produce impressive results. seeing your game running smooth at 60fps makes you forget about hours spent debugging import errors.

until next Unity update breaks everything again.

I'm just getting tired, I have been pushing this project through the hot summer whilst combining it with work and I lost my current appetite for Unity atm.
