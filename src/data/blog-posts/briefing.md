# 🚀 The Briefing: A Deep Dive into Independent Tech Exploration

Over the next few weeks, I’ll be stepping away from traditional assignments to dive headfirst into a topic I’m passionate about: exploring new technology through experimentation, research, and development.

## 🎯 What’s This All About?

This course is all about **immersion and exploration**. It's a chance to apply everything I’ve learned during my two years in the Devine program and more importantly, to go beyond it. Devine has always focused on *lifelong learning*, and this project is an example of that mindset. Here, I’m not just building something. I’m challenging myself to:

- Investigate a new or evolving technology  
- Learn independently and document the process  
- Make mistakes, iterate, and grow from them  

There’s no commercial client or assignment brief. Just me, my curiosity, and a blank canvas.

## 💡 The Role I’m Taking On

I’ll be approaching this project as an **independent expert**. That means:

- Creating and owning my own **planning**, **milestones**, and **deliverables**  
- Making regular **reflections** and **decisions** on my development direction  
- Keeping in close contact with Wouter, my coach and Devine Lecturer, who will help guide my process  
- Documenting every step here, from missteps to breakthroughs

## 🧠 What You’ll Find on This Blog

This blog is my **public diary**. I’ll be updating it regularly with:

- The **technologies** and **tools** I’m investigating  
- The **resources** I’m consulting  
- My **successes** and the **roadblocks** I hit  
- **Benchmarks**, **comparisons**, and key learnings  
- Plans for my **next steps**, including things I want to pivot, improve, or explore further  

I'll also share how feedback (from peers and coaches) has helped refine my thinking and development approach.

## 🛠️ GitHub: Open from Day One

In the spirit of working in the open, you can follow my project’s progress on [https://github.com/FrederikDG/VIRTUAL-INSANITY](github). Here you'll find everything I'm working on.

## 🔍 Coming Soon: Research Question & Planning

I’ll soon publish a dedicated post where I’ll outline:

- A short and sharp **core project statement**  
- My planned **deliverables**  

This forms the foundation for my project and ensures that I stay on track of the core.
