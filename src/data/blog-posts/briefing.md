# The Briefing

for the next few weeks i'm doing this independent project instead of regular assignments. basically pick something i want to learn and go deep on it.

the whole point is immersion and exploration. apply what i've learned in the past two years at devine and push beyond it. devine's always been about lifelong learning so this is putting that into practice.

## what i'm doing

treating this like i'm my own boss. that means creating my own planning, setting milestones, making deliverables. staying in touch with wouter who's coaching me through the process.

documenting everything here - what technologies i'm investigating, resources i'm using, successes and roadblocks. benchmarks, comparisons, key learnings. plans for next steps including things i want to pivot or improve.

## what you'll find here

this is my public diary basically. regular updates with the tools i'm testing, mistakes i'm making, breakthroughs when they happen. also how feedback from peers and coaches is helping refine my approach.

everything's on github from day one too - https://github.com/FrederikDG/VIRTUAL-INSANITY

## coming up

next post will outline my core project statement and planned deliverables. that's the foundation that keeps me on track.
