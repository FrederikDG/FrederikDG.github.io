# Laptop Development Hell - When Your Project Becomes Machine-Specific

I had a consult scheduled with Wouter and figured I'd work on the project from my laptop instead of lugging my desktop setup to school. Should be simple, right? Same Unity version, same project files, same headset. What could go wrong?

Everything. Everything could go wrong.

## The Great Package Disaster

First problem: the project wouldn't even open. Unity kept throwing errors about missing packages, even though I had committed everything to version control. Turns out some of the Meta XR SDK components don't play nice when moved between machines.

The packages were "there" but also "not there." They showed up in the Package Manager but with error icons. Half the scripts were missing references. The OVRCameraRig prefab was completely broken, showing as empty GameObjects with missing components.

I tried reimporting the packages, clearing the package cache, deleting and re-adding the Meta XR SDK. Nothing worked consistently. Some components would fix themselves, others would break in new creative ways.

## The GPU Nightmare

My desktop has a decent RTX 4080. My laptop has... a laptop 3060 that Unity barely acknowledges exists. Suddenly my "optimized" VR project that ran smoothly on desktop was getting 5fps in the editor.

But the real kicker? The Quest 3 couldn't even connect properly. USB-C link kept failing, wireless streaming was a stuttering mess, and when I finally got it connected, the tracking was all jittery.


## The ComfyUI Catastrophe

Remember that Unity-ComfyUI integration I was so proud of? Completely broken on the laptop. The HTTP requests were timing out, the file paths were wrong (Windows vs Windows, somehow), and even when I got ComfyUI running locally, it was so slow that mesh generation took literally five minutes instead of 30 seconds.

The laptop's CPU apparently laughs at the idea of running AI inference in any reasonable timeframe.

## Version Rollback Panic

With the consult approaching fast, I made the painful decision to roll back to an earlier version of the project - one from before I added the latest ComfyUI features and performance optimizations. Basically a month of work, unavailable for the demo.

This version was more stable, had fewer dependencies, and crucially, had worked on the laptop before. But it meant showing Wouter a less impressive version of the project than what I actually had working on my main machine.

## Lessons Learned

I'm not wasting any more time trying to make this project work perfectly on my laptop. It's just not worth the frustration. From now on, I'll stick to my main development machine for anything critical, and treat the laptop as a backup or for lightweight tasks only. Sometimes, the best fix is to avoid the problem entirely.
