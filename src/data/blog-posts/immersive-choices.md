# Picking the Right Tools

second thing to figure out was how to actually make this happen. not just vague "i want VR" but actual hardware and software choices.

## headset decision

bunch of options out there but the big names are quest 3 and vision pro. lucky for me i already have a quest 3 from last year. been using it for gaming and movies so that makes the choice easy - i own it, it works well, don't need to buy anything new.

vision pro has insane quality but it's expensive as hell and limited right now. maybe test on it later if i can get access.

## unity vs unreal

originally planned to use unity. know c#, it's the default for VR, seemed obvious.

then wouter asked if i looked into unreal engine 5. so i researched it and yeah, unreal looks incredible. gorgeous visuals, powerful tools. some of my favorite VR games like walking dead saints & sinners were built in unreal.

but unreal uses c++ and i'm not fluent. dabbled enough to poke around but building something full-scale? that'd be learning c++ AND VR development simultaneously.

after messing with both engines i came back to unity. just quicker for me to get something working. unreal has perks especially for visuals but for this first attempt at full VR experience i want to build, not get stuck learning syntax.
