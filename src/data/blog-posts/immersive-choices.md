So the second thing that we have to think about is how we can actually make this a feasable project and how I'm going to approach it. There are multiple ways of coding a VR experience and also multiple brands and types of VR headsets. With the main market leaders being the meta quest 3 and the flopped vision pro from apple.

I have the luck of already owning a meta quest 3 since last year and loved playing games and watching movies on it. So that already gives that an edge as I dont have to worry about availability or lending, etc.

Now the vision pro offers higher quality content which could also be interesting.

For coding the experience, I had, before I talked to wouter, 1 main environment, Unity. This platform works with C# and as I'm familiar there that seemed like the obvious choice. but! Wouter also asked me to look into Unreal Engine 5 for the possibilities on that end. I've worked with Unreal in the past but am quite primitive in C++ but I did figure out that my favorite VR game, (The walking dead: saints and sinners) is infact coded over there! The more you know.

After some research, for me it was clear that I was going to use Unity as I didnt want to focus on learning Unreal properly to actially put something up. (even though they do offer some nice quirks)
