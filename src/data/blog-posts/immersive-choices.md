Alright, so the second thing I had to think about was: how do I actually make this whole idea *happen*? As in, how do I turn this into something real and working, not just a vague "I want to make VR" thought floating in my notes app?, 
There’s a bunch of ways to approach building a VR experience. And not just on the software side. There’s a whole jungle of headsets out there too. But right now, the biggest names are still the **Meta Quest 3** and the (let’s be real) kinda flopped **Apple Vision Pro**.

Lucky for me, I already have a Meta Quest 3. Got it last year, been using it for gaming, watching movies, the whole deal. So that makes the choice easier: I already own it, it works great, and I don’t have to go around asking someone to borrow theirs or sell a kidney for another one.

That said, the Vision Pro does have some insane quality going for it. Super crispy visuals, fancy interactions... but also super expensive and kind of limited right now. Still, it *could* be fun to test something out on it later down the line.

### Coding it: Unity vs Unreal

Now for the nerdy part: how do I *build* this thing?

Before I had a chat with Wouter, I was fully planning to use **Unity**. It’s solid, I know my way around C#, and it’s kind of the default for VR stuff anyway. Easy choice.

**But!** Then Wouter asked me if I looked into Unreal Engine 5?

So I did. And yeah, Unreal looks sick. It’s gorgeous, the tools are powerful, and turns out one of my fave VR games: *The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners* was actually built in Unreal!

Thing is... Unreal uses **C++**, and I am *not* fluent. I’ve dabbled. Enough to poke around. But building something full-on in it? That’d be a project *on top* of the project.

After messing around with both, I came back to Unity. It’s just quicker for me to get something up and running. Sure, Unreal has its perks (especially for visuals), but for this first go at making a full VR thing. I wanna build, not get stuck learning syntax.

So yeah, Unity it is. Meta Quest 3. C#. Let’s build something immersive.

More soon.
