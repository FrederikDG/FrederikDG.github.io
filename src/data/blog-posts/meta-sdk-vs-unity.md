# Two APIs, One Headache

two weeks in and keep hitting same wall: go all-in on Meta's XR SDK or stick with Unity's XR Interaction Toolkit? trying to use both feels like getting directions from two different people.

## Meta's approach

Meta's All-in-One SDK is solid. building blocks for hand tracking, passthrough, interaction are polished. grab their prefabs for controllers or hands and they work. OVRCameraRig handles head tracking cleanly, interaction system feels natural.

but it's all Meta. want to add something outside their toolkit? good luck making it compatible. their components have specific usage patterns and stepping outside means you're on your own.

## Unity's approach  

Unity's XR Interaction Toolkit is more flexible. mix and match components, extend base classes, hack things together how you want. built for cross-platform so code isn't locked to Quest.

downside is it feels generic. getting hand tracking smooth takes more setup. default interactions lack Meta polish. things that work out-of-box with Meta's SDK need extensive configuration in Unity's system.

## the real problem

nightmare starts when trying to use both. started with Meta's SDK because easier setup. then needed custom interactions that Unity's toolkit handles better. now have OVRCameraRig for tracking but XRRayInteractor for UI interactions.

they don't always agree on interaction states. spent afternoon debugging why ray interactions broke - Meta's hand tracking was overriding Unity's interaction system.

## current solution

mostly using Meta's SDK for core VR - tracking, passthrough, hand detection. Unity's XR components for custom interactions needing flexibility. not clean but functional.

lesson is probably pick one and commit from start. but prototyping different approaches leads to frankenstein setup whether you want it or not.

maybe Meta and Unity will figure out better compatibility eventually. or maybe i'll get better at working around their differences.

definitely not the seamless experience i hoped for starting out.
