# From Photo to 3D Model

got VR basics working but next hurdle was turning photos from inside headset into actual 3D meshes. something with depth that could be brought back into virtual world.

## paid service options

there are commercial services for this:

- **Kaedim** - sleek UI, quick turnaround, good for stylized game assets
- **Luma AI** - photorealistic results, captures light and texture well  
- **RealityCapture** - pro-level photogrammetry, handles huge datasets

these work because they offload heavy lifting to cloud compute, handle photogrammetry pipelines with single upload, often include texture baking and PBR export.

but didn't want paywall dependency or processing queues. wanted local solution running on my hardware. pushes project toward PCVR but at least i can tinker.

## huggingface alternatives

found open-source options on huggingface for image-to-mesh conversion:

- **Stable Video 3D** - by Stability AI, surprisingly good single-image reconstructions
- **Zero123++** - generates multi-view images from one photo then reconstructs 3D
- **Volinga** - newer experiment using NeRF-style approaches

benefits: free, fully local (good for privacy and fast iteration), highly hackable and composable with other AI workflows.

## ComfyUI + Trellis approach

ended up diving into Trellis, relatively new but handles NeRFs and mesh reconstruction well. someone made ComfyUI nodes for it so could integrate into existing AI pipeline without rewriting everything.

wasn't plug-and-play. original nodes built for Linux so on Windows had to:
- switch torch and python versions
- patch shell commands into batch scripts  
- tweak CUDA paths and recompile components

eventually with enough troubleshooting got first mesh from single VR snapshot. looked decent - not AAA-ready but usable for prototyping in engine.
