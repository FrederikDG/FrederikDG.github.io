# Hand Tracking Reality

controllers are easy. press button, thing happens. move controller, tracks perfectly. simple, reliable, boring.

hand tracking? hand tracking is where things get spicy.

## promise vs reality

Meta's marketing makes hand tracking look magical. just reach out and grab things! point at UI elements! natural gestures! no controllers needed!

what they don't show is five minutes waving hands trying to get tracking to kick in. grab detection working maybe 60% of time. pointing at UI requiring surgeon precision.

## getting started

setting up hand tracking in Unity with Meta's SDK is straightforward. enable in project settings, add components to scene, boom - virtual hands following real hands.

that part works great. hands move, fingers bend, looks like you're really there. very cool.

then you try grabbing something and realize you've made terrible mistake.

## grab detection hell

with controllers grab is binary. button pressed = grab, not pressed = not grab. with hands system has to guess when you're "trying to grab" based on finger positions and object proximity.

sometimes clearly grabbing something and doesn't register. sometimes just moving hand near object and suddenly snaps to palm. sometimes tracking loses hand entirely and objects fly around scene.

## grip strength nightmare

Meta's hand tracking uses "grip strength" concept - how tightly you're making fist. in theory lets you control how firmly you hold objects.

in practice means constantly fighting system about whether you're "holding" something. relax grip slightly? object drops. grip too tight? hand shakes from effort and object wobbles.

spent hours tweaking grip threshold values trying to find sweet spot where objects stay in hand without death grip.

## UI interaction pain

pointing at UI with finger sounds natural but way less forgiving than controller laser pointer. hand always moving slightly so cursor jitters constantly. hitting small buttons becomes exercise in frustration.

ended up making all UI buttons way bigger than wanted just so people could hit them reliably. very elegant.

## pinch gesture rabbit hole

Meta pushes pinch gesture (thumb to index) as primary selection method. supposed to be more precise than grab gestures.

is more precise when it works. but detection is finicky. too light and nothing happens. too firm and registers multiple pinches. move hand while pinching and might lose tracking entirely.

implemented fallback systems for when pinch fails but then have weird interaction model where sometimes pinch, sometimes grab, sometimes point. users never know which works.

## performance hit

hand tracking is computationally expensive. Quest doing real-time computer vision on 20+ hand points multiple times per second. absolutely murders framerate if not careful.

had to dial back visual effects and optimize everything else to maintain 90fps with hand tracking enabled. still get occasional hitches when tracking does something heavy.

## when it works

despite complaints when hand tracking works well it's genuinely magical. something visceral about reaching out and manipulating objects with actual hands instead of pressing buttons.

moments when grab detection works perfectly, when you naturally point and select, when grip responds exactly right - those make frustration worth it.

## my approach

ended up going back to controllers. hand interactions are cool but waste of time for what i'm trying to achieve in this timeframe.

hand tracking clearly the future. more natural, more immersive, no controllers to carry. but we're in early days.

technology will get better, algorithms smarter, interaction models more standardized. but right now still bit of wild west.

if building something where precision matters stick with controllers. want to show off future of VR interaction and don't mind jank? hand tracking worth experimenting with.

just be prepared to spend lots of time tweaking sensitivity values.
