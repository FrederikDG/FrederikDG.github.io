# Quest 3 Is Not a Gaming PC

here's revelation: Quest 3 is not gaming PC. shocking right? but when coming from developing on desktop with decent GPU performance constraints of mobile VR headset hit like brick wall.

## the wake-up call

project was running great in Unity editor. smooth 90fps, responsive interactions, beautiful lighting. feeling pretty good about it.

then built for Quest and everything went to hell.

suddenly getting 20fps, frame drops every time spawned object, hand tracking so laggy basically unusable. ComfyUI integration that takes 15 seconds on PC? try 45 seconds on Quest if doesn't crash first.

## mobile VR reality

Quest 3 is impressive for what it is but "what it is" is basically high-end phone strapped to face. Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 is fast for mobile but not even close to desktop GPU.

VR has nasty requirement where need to maintain 90fps consistently. drop below that and people get motion sick. can't just accept occasional frame drops like regular game.

## what actually works

after weeks optimization here's what learned:

**keep it simple.** mobile VR rewards clean simple designs over complex detailed ones.

**profile constantly.** Unity's profiler is your friend. use it before performance problems get out of hand.

**test on device always.** something running fine in editor might be slideshow on Quest.

**embrace constraints.** instead of fighting hardware limitations design around them.

## visual compromise

hardest part was accepting VR project would never look as good as originally envisioned. those beautiful lighting setups and detailed textures? not happening.

but here's thing: when in VR presence matters more than pixels. simple environment that runs smoothly infinitely better than beautiful one that stutters.

## current state

still not hitting consistent 90fps with all features enabled but close. project runs smoothly enough for actual use which is what matters.

next challenge is adding more features without tanking performance again. every new system needs designed with Quest's limitations in mind from day one.

frustrating compared to desktop development but also kind of liberating. when can't rely on brute force hardware have to be clever about solutions.

plus if can make this work well on Quest 3 it'll absolutely fly on more powerful hardware.

## lessons for mobile VR

- profile early and often
- test on target hardware constantly  
- design for constraints not against them
- smooth framerate beats pretty graphics
- simple and functional wins over complex and broken

mobile VR development is different beast than desktop. sooner you accept that sooner you can build something that actually works instead of something that looks good in editor.
