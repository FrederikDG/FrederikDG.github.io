## About My Project: Creating a VR Experience

Within this course, I have the opportunity to dive deep into a technology of my choice through a personal passion project. My focus will be on developing a Virtual Reality (VR) experience. This project is designed to encourage experimentation, exploration, and taking on new challenges beyond the regular curriculum.

### Project Approach

- **Personal Exploration:**  
    I will use the knowledge gained during my two years in Devine, but also push myself to learn independently and explore new VR technologies, frameworks, and design patterns.

- **Independent Research:**  
    The project is not for a commercial partner, allowing me to experiment freely, make mistakes, and learn from them. I will document my process, reflect on my choices, and justify my technical decisions.

- **Planning & Milestones:**  
    I am responsible for setting my own schedule, defining milestones, and outlining deliverables. Regular check-ins with my coach will help me stay on track and refine my approach.

### Documentation & Community

- **Blog:**  
    This blog will serve as a detailed log of my journey. I will share resources consulted, feedback received, technologies investigated, benchmarks, challenges faced, and plans for next steps.

- **GitHub:**  
    My project will be public on GitHub from the start, allowing others to follow my progress and provide feedback.

### Research Question & Deliverables

- **Research Question:**  
    What are the best practices and challenges in designing an engaging and accessible VR experience for new users?

- **Deliverables:**  
    - A working VR prototype  
    - Detailed documentation of the development process  
    - Regular blog updates  
    - Source code and project files on GitHub  
    - Final presentation and showcase video

### Evaluation

Throughout the project, I will demonstrate my ability to independently acquire new skills, communicate my process, and deliver a polished VR experience. The final result will be presented to an external jury, showcasing both my technical and reflective growth as a developer.

Stay tuned as I document my progress, share insights, and reflect on the journey of creating a VR experience!
